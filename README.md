## Overview

Voxel is a Python package that provides core components and functionality for
controlling Light Sheet Microscopy systems. It is designed to simplify the
process of developing software for novel microscope setups by focusing on
modular composable components. Voxel is built on the following principles:

1. **Modular**: Each component (device, writer, processor) implements a common
   interface and can be easily swapped out.
2. **Configurable**: Microscope setups are defined in a human readable YAML
   configuration file, allowing for easy setup and modification.
3. **Extensible**: New devices and components can be easily added by
   implementing the appropriate interface.
4. **Pythonic**: Written in Python and designed to be easily understood and
   modified.

Voxel provides two key Classes: `Instrument` and `Acquisition`.

### Instrument

The `Instrument` class focuses on the composition and structure of the
microscope setup. At its core, an instrument is a collection of devices that
implement the `VoxelDevice` interface. An `instrument.yaml` file defines the
devices and their respective settings. Devices are defined by providing their
python package, module, and class name as well as any initialization arguments
and settings.

Checkout an example
[instrument configuration yaml](#2-instrument-yaml-configuration) and the
[Devices](#devices) section for a list of supported devices and their respective
drivers.

### Acquisition

The `Acquisition` class focuses on the execution of an imaging experiment. It is
responsible for coordinating the devices in the instrument to capture and
process data. The `Acquisition` class is primarily set up as an abstract class
that can be subclassed to implement specific acquisition protocols. It provides
several methods that are useful in the implementation of an acquisition
protocol. A run method is defined that should be overridden by the subclass in
order to define a specific protocol for a given microscope design. For an
example of an acquisition protocol, check out the
[ExaSpim Acquisiton Class](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/exaspim-control/blob/main/exaspim_control/exa_spim_acquisition.py)

### Utilities

Voxel also provides additional utilities useful for performing imaging
experiments. This includes classes for writing data, performing online
processing of imaging data, and concurrent transferring of data to external
storage.

Checkout the [Writers](#writers) and [File Transfers](#file-transfers) for a
list of supported writers and file transfer methods and the
[Processes](#processes) section for a list of supported processors.

### Usage

#### 1. Single device

Individual device can be instantiated by importing the appropriate driver class
with the expected arguments. For example a camera object for a Vieworks VP-151MX
can be invoked as:

```python
from voxel.devices.camera.vieworks_egrabber import VieworksCamera

camera = VieworksCamera(id='123456')
```

Camera properties can then be queried and set by accessing attributes of the
camera object:

```python
camera.exposure_time ms = 10.0
camera.pixel_type = 'mono16'
camera.bit_packing_mode = 'lsb'
camera.binning = 1
camera.width_px = 14192
camera.height_px = 10640
camera.trigger = {'mode': 'on', 'source': 'line0', 'polarity': 'risingedge'}
```

The camera can then be operated with:

```python
camera.prepare() # this function arms and creates the camera buffer
camera.start()
image = camera.grab_frame()
camera.stop()
camera.close()
```

#### 2. Instrument YAML configuration

```yaml
instrument:
    devices:
        vp-151mx camera:
        type: camera
        driver: voxel.devices.camera.simulated
        module: SimulatedCamera
        init:
            id: 123456
        settings:
            exposure_time_ms: 10.0
            pixel_type: mono16
            height_offest_px: 0
            height_px: 2048
            width_offset_px: 0
            width_px: 2048
            trigger:
            mode: off
            polarity: rising
            source: external
        488 nm laser:
        type: laser
        driver: voxel.devices.lasers.simulated
        module: SimulatedLaser
        init:
            id: COM1
        x axis stage:
        type: scanning_stage
        driver: voxel.devices.stage.simulated
        module: Stage
        init:
            hardware_axis: x
            instrument_axis: z
        settings:
            speed_mm_s: 1.0
```

An instrument can be invoked by loading the YAML file with and the loaded
devices can be accessed with. The above example uses all simulated device
classes.

```python
from voxel.instruments.instrument import Instrument

instrument = Instrument(config_path='example.yaml')
instrument.cameras['vp-151mx camera']
instrument.lasers['488 nm laser']
instrument.scanning_stages['x axis stage']
```

#### 3. Experimental workflows may then be scripted by using the full instrument object and the contained device objects as needed

# Voxel

Voxel is a general microscope control package designed to simplify the process
of configuring and controlling different microscopy systems. Voxel provides two
key modules:

1. **Instrument**: `VoxelInstrument`

   Defining and controlling a collection of devices through a configuration YAML
   file. The instrument module is designed to be flexible and extensible
   supporting various device types each with their own base class.

   The devices are defined in `voxel.instrument.devices.<device-type>` and
   include:

   - camera: `VoxelCamera`
   - lens: `VoxelLens`
   - laser: `VoxelLaser`
   - filter: `VoxelFilterWheel`, `VoxelFilter`
   - linear_axis: `VoxelLinearAxis`
   - rotation_axis: `VoxelRotationAxis`
   - flip_mount: `VoxelFlipMount`
   - power_meter: `VoxelPowerMeter`

   A voxel compatible device driver is one that inherits from the appropriate
   base class and implements the required methods.

   In addition to the device classes, the instrument module also includes a
   `VoxelNIDAQ` class that abstracts the `nidaqmx` SDK and allows for `AO`,
   `DO`, and `CO` tasks for controlling supported devices such as AOTFs,
   cameras, and axes.

   Instruments can be defined as a collection of any set of devices through a
   configuraiton YAML file, typically named `instrument.yaml`. The configuration
   file is used to build the instrument object and instantiate the devices with
   the appropriate settings. Classes `InstrumentConfig` and `InstrumentFactory`
   handle the reading and parsing of the configuration file and the creation of
   the instrument object respectively.

   A complete list of available device drivers can be found in the
   [Device Drivers](#device-drivers) section.

2. **Acquisition**: `VoxelAcquisition`, `VoxelAcquisitionEngine`

   Performing imaging experiments with the defined instrument. This includes
   classes for writing data and concurrent transferring of data to external
   storage.

Voxel also provides additional utilities useful for performing imaging
experiments including tools for performing online processing of imaging data
under the `voxel.kit` module.

## Installation 2

### Prerequisites 2

- **Python>=3.7** (tested) (Recommended to install via
  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or
  [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- **eGrabber** (Windows and Linux) To control the Vieworks VP-151MX camera you
  will need
  [eGrabber for CoaxLink and GigELink](https://www.euresys.com/en/Support/Download-area?Series=105d06c5-6ad9-42ff-b7ce-622585ce607f)
  installed for your particular system. Note that, to download the eGrabber SDK,
  you will first need to make an account. After downloading and installing
  eGrabber, you will need to install the eGrabber python package (stored as a
  wheel file). For more info installing the Python wheel file, see the
  [notes from Euresys](https://documentation.euresys.com/Products/COAXLINK/COAXLINK/en-us/Content/04_eGrabber/programmers-guide/Python.htm).

  Generally, the process should be as simple as finding the wheel package in the
  eGrabber subfolder and invoking:

  ```bash
  pip install egrabber-xx.xx.x.xx-py2.py3-none-any.whl
  ```

- **DCAM** (Windows only) To control Hamamatsu cameras you will need
  [DCAM API](https://dcam-api.com/) installed for your particular system.
- **Coherent HOPS** (Windows only) To control Coherent Genesis series lasers,
  you will need to install Coherent HOPS. _(instructions coming soon)_

### Installation Steps

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it: On Windows:

   ```bash
   conda create -n voxel
   conda activate voxel
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/voxel.git
   ```

3. To use the software, in the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. To develop the code, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Usage 2

1. Instantiating a single device:

   Individual device can be instantiated by importing the appropriate driver
   class with the expected arguments. For example a camera object for a Vieworks
   VP-151MX can be invoked as:

   ```python
   from voxel.instrument.devices.camera import VieworksCamera

   camera = VieworksCamera(id='123456')
   ```

   Camera properties can then be queried and set by accessing attributes of the
   camera object:

   ```python
   camera.exposure_time ms = 10.0
   camera.pixel_type = 'mono16'
   camera.bit_packing_mode = 'lsb'
   camera.binning = 1
   camera.width_px = 14192
   camera.height_px = 10640
   camera.trigger = {'mode': 'on', 'source': 'line0', 'polarity': 'risingedge'}
   ```

   The camera can then be operated with:

   ```python
   camera.prepare() # this function arms and creates the camera buffer
   camera.start()
   image = camera.grab_frame()
   camera.stop()
   camera.close()
   ```

2. Voxel facilitates defining entire instruments through a YAML file:

   ```yaml
   instrument:
   devices:
       vp-151mx camera:
       type: camera
       driver: voxel.devices.camera.simulated
       module: SimulatedCamera
       init:
           id: 123456
       settings:
           exposure_time_ms: 10.0
           pixel_type: mono16
           height_offest_px: 0
           height_px: 2048
           width_offset_px: 0
           width_px: 2048
           trigger:
           mode: off
           polarity: rising
           source: external
       488 nm laser:
       type: laser
       driver: voxel.devices.lasers.simulated
       module: SimulatedLaser
       init:
           id: COM1
       x axis stage:
       type: scanning_stage
       driver: voxel.devices.stage.simulated
       module: Stage
       init:
           hardware_axis: x
           instrument_axis: z
       settings:
           speed_mm_s: 1.0
   ```

   An instrument can be invoked by loading the YAML file with and the loaded
   devices can be accessed with. The above example uses all simulated device
   classes.

   ```python
   from voxel.instrument.instrument import Instrument

   instrument = Instrument(config_path='example.yaml')
   instrument.cameras['vp-151mx camera']
   instrument.lasers['488 nm laser']
   instrument.scanning_stages['x axis stage']
   ```

3. Experimental workflows may then be scripted by using the full instrument
   object and the contained device objects as needed:

   _(example coming soon)_
